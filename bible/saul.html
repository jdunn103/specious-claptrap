  <h1>Saul</h1>
  <p>Saul was this guy who hated Jesus and wanted to kill all of his followers and 
      <a href='disciples.html'>disciples</a>. His views were then turned around when
       <a href='jesus.html'>Jesus</a> visited Saul, said, "I'm mad at you Saul!" and blinded him (Saul). Then Jesus
      chose Saul to preach around the world and suddenly Saul believed in Jesus.
