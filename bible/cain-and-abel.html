    <h1>Cain and Abel</h1>
    <p>Cain and Abel were <a href='adam-and-eve.html'>Adam and Eve</a>'s oldest children. Cain was a farmer and Abel was a shepherd. 
        When they both offered gifts to <a href='god.html'>God</a>, He only accepted Abel's gift because He thought sheep were better than grains.
        Cain got really mad and killed Abel. He was banished and became a wanderer. He went and had kids with "other people" who existed.</p>
