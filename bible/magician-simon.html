    <h1>Magician Simon</h1>
    <p>Magician Simon was a magician by the name of Simon who performed fake magic.
        He was performing his fake magic in Samaria when <a href="phillip.html">Phillip</a>
        found him there pretending that he could bring a person back from the dead. Phillip was 
        like, "Hey, you! You are not a genuine resurrector! Let me show you audience members
        how you actually do it because I believe in <a href="jesus.html">Jesus</a> so yeah!"
    And he brought the dead mom back to life. And Magician Simon was like, "Wow, if I had this 
    Jesus person on my side, I could ACTUALLY bring people back to life and then people would 
    actually want to come see my 'magic'." So Magician Simon was baptized by Phillip and then 
asked <a href='peter.html'>Peter</a> for some of his connection with <a href="god.html">God</a>
 and Jesus in exchange for a few coins, and 
 Peter was like, "GOD IS NOT WORTH MONEY!!" and God killed Magician Simon.</p>
