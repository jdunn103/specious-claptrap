    <h1>Ethiopian Guy</h1>
    <p>The Ethiopian Guy was a guy who visited Jerusalem. He was like,
        "We have left our weapons outside of the city." They were searched by the Romans and the 
        Romans found nothing with them. Little did they know that the Ethiopians were plotting against
        them with the <a href='leader-of-the-assassin-people.html'>Assassin people</a>. They were 
        discovered and the Ethiopian guy was in big trouble. He 
        was sent away to die. However, he was discovered by <a href='philip.html'>Philip</a> and 
        Philip baptized him. Philip magically disappeared into the air. 
        Then he laughed really hard and splashed everywhere without 
        wondering where Philip had disappeared to. Poor Philip.
