    <h1>Adam and Eve</h1>
    <p>Adam was the first human, he was made out of dust. Eve was the second human, she was made out of Adam's rib.</p>
    <p>They didn't have a care in the world because they were living in the Garden of Eden, the land of paradise, but 
        then a snake told Eve to eat an apple from the forbidden apple tree and Eve told Adam to eat one as well.
        They got really embarrassed about being naked and grew wise. <a href='god.html'>God</a> 
        got really mad at Eve and the snake so he made it so that every time a woman had a baby it would really hurt and 
        he took away the snake's legs. He wasn't really mad at Adam so he just made him have a lump in his throat 
        to remind about how he ate the apple.</p>
    <p>Adam and Eve later had <a href='cain-and-abel.html'>Cain and Abel</a> and even later they had Seth and "other children".</p>
