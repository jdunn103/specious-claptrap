    <h1>Mary and Joseph</h1>
    <p>Mary and Joseph raised <a href='jesus.html'>Jesus</a>.
         An <a href='angels.html'>Angel</a> told Mary that <a href='god.html'>God</a> had given her a baby and Mary got pregnant.
         People wanted to stone Mary for being pregnant without being married but then Joseph married her.
         Mary almost gave birth on a donkey.</p>
