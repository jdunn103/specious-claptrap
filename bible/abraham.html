    <h1>Abraham</h1>
    <p>Abraham was a man who <a href='god.html'>God</a> spoke to.
    He brought everybody in his town to the Promised Land. 
    He had <a href='ishmael-and-hagar.html'>Ishmael with Hagar</a>,
    he had <a href='isaac.html'>Isaac</a> with <a href='sarah.html'>Sarah</a>, 
    and he had other not as important children with Keturah.
    One day God asked him to sacrifice Isaac so Abraham took
    Isaac up a hill and right when he stabbed him an Angel appeared
    and made the knife miss Isaac and then the Angel made a goat appear
    to sacrifice to God instead of Isaac.</p>
