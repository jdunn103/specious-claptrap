  <h1>Caligula</h1>
  <p>Caligula was a Roman guy who was a jerk. He killed <a href="tiberius.html">Tiberius</a> 
    [King Caesar] which prevented <a href="pilate.html">Pilate</a> from obtaining his 
    position in Rome promised to him by Tiberius. Caligula then sent a gold statue 
    of him (Caligula) to go in the temple at Jerusalem, which caused a ton of problems, yet he
    didn't care one tiny bit about that.
