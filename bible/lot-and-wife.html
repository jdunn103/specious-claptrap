    <h1>Lot</h1>
    <p>Lot was <a href='abraham.html'>Abraham</a>'s
         nephew who went to Sodom but then got saved
         by the <a href='angels.html'>Angels</a> when <a href='god.html'>God</a> destroyed Sodom.
         When the Angels got to his house,
         a crowd of people demanded that the Angels be sent out 
         into the crowd so that could 'get to know them better.'
         Instead of giving the crowd the Angels, 
         he offered them his two virgin daughters but they didn't want them.
         On their way out his wife turned into salt when she looked back at the city after the angels told her not to.</p>
