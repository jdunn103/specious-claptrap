  <h1>Simon</h1>
  <p>Simon was this very interesting guy who was a <a href="disciples.html">disciple</a>
  of <a href='jesus.html'>Jesus</a> but was mad when <a href='peter.html'>Peter</a> accepted
  <a href="saul.html">Saul</a> as a member of their "group" and so went to
  <a href="leader-of-the-assassin-people.html">the leader of the assassin people</a> and 
  <a href='eva.html'>Eva</a> to join them in their killing. He said that he was committed
  to them, but when he started realizing that perhaps Saul actually was connected to Jesus, 
  he was like, "Oh no... I've put myself in a very sticky situation that's going to be hard 
  to get out of." So it's okay if you kinda don't like him.</p>
